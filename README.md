  > **Created by Chuck DeBrosse**

  ### Description
  This is an app that uses a series of prompts in your CLI that turns your answers into a dynamic HTML file. This file will produce a portfolio page that displays every member of your team, their roles, and other details taken from your answers. The app was tested with Jest. Below is a screenshot of the test run and the subsequent passing suites.

When you successfully complete a run through the app, your finished HTML product will look something like the screenshot below:
